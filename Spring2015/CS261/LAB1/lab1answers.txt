1.Yes the answers shown were the ones expected from the program.

2.Everything worked as expected.

3.The -m32 flag caused the gcc to exit with an error status and after trying the reccomendations we were unable to generate any file.

4.The command ./a.out refers to the program in the local directory while a.out by itself refers to a bash program.

5.The first one is making an object hello.out with assuming the 32bit processing  on level 2 optimization. The second is the same but the output file is named a.out and will output the assimbly code as well.

6.Only for which the program was gcc'ed kn can it be executed without re gcc'ing the 
source code

7.The first is for piping the output of one command into the input of another,the 
second is for forcing the output file, the third is for thenreferencing if the jnout 
file,the fourth is for setup of the moving a process forward or backward in viewing, 
the last two are for moving the process that has been set by & to the forground ,fg, 
and background,bg.
