#1: what are the two most important aspects of caching?

	Spatial memory - basically things near each other are more likely to 
	be used at similar times. An array, a functions machine code, etc.

	Temporal memory - things accessed in the past are likely to be
	accessed again. If I called one function reacently I probably will
	call it more so keep it in the cache.


#2: Given the fact that the cache size is 1024 bytes and the block size is 8 words, 
how many bits are in the tag, index, offset fields if the cache is fully associative 
and the address is 32 bits? Answer the question for a direct mapped cache and a 4-way 
set-associative cache with the same cache size of 1024 bytes and block size of 8 words.

	The cache is 1024 bytes so that means there are 32 blocks of 32 bytes each. The tag
	is 32 - 5 or 27 bits, because 2^5=32 which is required for the addressing in each block.

	And in a 4-way set-associative cache it is subdivided into 4 or 2^2, then into which means
	that each set holds 8 or 2^3 blocks of 8 or 2^3. The tag is 32 - 2 - 3 - 3 or 24. The index
	is 5 bits and the offset field is 3 bits.

#3: What is the miss rate using the histogram example and the cache organizations above 
(i.e. direct, 4-way associative and fully-associative cache)?

	4-way associativity: 18.5% miss rate
	fully associative: 28.4% miss rate
