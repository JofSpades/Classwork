I have a personal cloud, OwnCloud on a basic XServer setup, in which I store my past code and unfinished iOS project. Follow the steps as listed to access them. If you don't wish to do this then I can send you a .zip file of all the files.

Swift/iOS code:
1. Go to the provided link to access the folder with password <iOS_Pr0ject> excluding the arrow heads.

2. All I have is a self signed certificate on the erver so you will be prompted about how the certificate dosn't meet your browsers standards.

Past work:
1. Go to the provided link to access the folder with password <P4stW0rk> excluding the arrow heads.

2. Same note as above about the lacking a "Properly signed certificate"
