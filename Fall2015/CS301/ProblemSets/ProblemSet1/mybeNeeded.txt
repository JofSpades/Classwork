Let there be an alphabet $\Sigma' = \{a' | a \in \Sigma \}$. Let there be homomorphisms un : ($\Sigma \cup \Sigma'$)* $\rightarrow \Sigma$* and rem : ($\Sigma \cup \Sigma'$)* $\rightarrow \Sigma$* such that un($a'$) = $a$ for $a' \in \Sigma'$, un($a$) = $a$ for $a \in \Sigma'$, rem($a'$) = $\epsilon \in \Sigma'$, and rem($a$) = $a$ for $a \in \Sigma$. Let $L_1$ be a language defined as un$^{-1}$($L$) making it regular because languages have been proven to stay closed under inverse homomorphisms, $L_1$ is the subset of strings that may have been marked with an apostrophe. Let there be an $L_2 = L_1 \cap \Sigma'$*$\Sigma$*, $L_2$ is the subset of strings where the first few characters are marked with an apostrophe. $L_2$ Is regular and closed because sets are kept closed and regular with intersection. Because $L_2$ is the same thing as \langop{Suffix} then \langop{Suffix} is seen to be closed and regular as well.
